"""Response security-header hardening for m8 FastAPI services.

Requires the ``fastapi`` extra::

    pip install "auth-sdk-m8[fastapi]"

Shared by every m8 FastAPI app — consumer services (via
``fastapi_m8.create_app``) and the auth provider (``fa-auth-m8``), which builds
its own ``FastAPI()`` app.  The hardening layer is gated on the same
``ENVIRONMENT == "production" or STRICT_PRODUCTION_MODE`` contract used for docs
hiding and ``TrustedHostMiddleware``, so local/dev (and Swagger/ReDoc/HMR) stay
unrestricted.

The settings fields the layer reads live on
:class:`auth_sdk_m8.core.config.CommonSettings`, so any service that subclasses
it (every m8 service) already exposes them.
